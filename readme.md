A fullstack website for any research lab using nodejs and mongodb.
we would also develop bi-directional communication (a chatbot ) between the user and the server using Socket.io which clarifies all the quries of the user regarding the lab.The development of the chatbot also includes the training of the chatbot using nlp.
The front end consists of About lab , About Mentor , Students , Achievements , Projects , Papers/journals published , patients recieved,My-Lab.
In general many of the lab works are not well recorded in a clean and neat manner(Like The tasks of the fellow teammats for the day,Daily contributions,Cost required for buying any materials like electronics,machinacal work,The oppourtunities they have and many more).For this purpose My-Lab comes to the picture.
My-lab is the important aspect of this project . It contains about the details of the team members of the project, the projects they completed and their currently working project details.
the projects they completed consists of their idea,project objectives,other team members,photos,videos,paper publication(if any).
Their present project details consists of :
1) The daily tasks assigned by the team leader
2) Monitoring Daily work progress
3) Issues to be solved ,Milestones reached
4) The money spent on buying different things
5) Things to buy
6) Todays contributions

The daily assesment details are used to train a machine learning model (preferablly time series forecasting )to understand the sincerity and the ability of the student.This helps the mentor to understand the abilities and the strengths of the student.
Based on the abouve data the next step could be making a performer of the week.
The details of the projects that have aldready completed by the students and their other details like papers/journals published or patients recieved could be used to generate a portfolio website of their own which could help them in campus placements, applying for further studies.
